    "# Use AutoGen in Databricks with DBRX\n",
    "\n",
    "![DBRX launch](https://www.databricks.com/en-blog-assets/static/2fe1a0af1ee0f6605024a810b604079c/dbrx-blog-header-optimized.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In March 2024, Databricks released [DBRX](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm), a general-purpose LLM that sets a new standard for open LLMs. While available as an open-source model on Hugging Face ([databricks/dbrx-instruct](https://huggingface.co/databricks/dbrx-instruct/tree/main) and [databricks/dbrx-base](https://huggingface.co/databricks/dbrx-base) ), customers of Databricks can also tap into the [Foundation Model APIs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/score-foundation-models.html#query-a-chat-completion-model), which make DBRX available through an OpenAI-compatible, autoscaling REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat) is becoming a popular standard for agent creation. Built to support any \"LLM as a service\" that implements the OpenAI SDK, it can easily be extended to integrate with powerful open source models. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate a few basic examples of Autogen with DBRX, including the use of  `AssistantAgent`, `UserProxyAgent`, and `ConversableAgent`. These demos are not intended to be exhaustive - feel free to use them as a base to build upon!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "AutoGen must be installed on your Databricks cluster, and requires `Python>=3.8`. This example includes the `%pip` magic command to install: `%pip install pyautogen`, as well as other necessary libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "This code has been tested on: \n",
    "* [Serverless Notebooks](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/serverless.html) (in public preview as of Apr 18, 2024)\n",
    "* Databricks Runtime 14.3 LTS ML [docs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/release-notes/runtime/14.3lts-ml.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "This code can run in any Databricks workspace in a region where DBRX is available via pay-per-token APIs (or provisioned throughput). To check if your region is supported, see [Foundation Model Region Availability](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/model-serving-limits.html#foundation-model-apis-limits). If the above is true, the workspace must also be enabled by an admin for Foundation Model APIs [docs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/foundation-models/index.html#requirements).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "* This notebook can be imported from github to a Databricks workspace and run directly. Use [sparse checkout mode with git](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/01/26/work-large-monorepos-sparse-checkout-support-databricks-repos.html) to import only this notebook or the examples directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Databricks recommends using [Secrets](https://docs.databricks.com/en/security/secrets/secrets.html) instead of storing tokens in plain text. "

We can write a Python script to count the number of prime numbers from 1 to 10000. Here's the script:\n\n```python\n# filename: count_primes.py\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef count_primes(end):\n    count = 0\n    for num in range(1, end + 1):\n        if is_prime(num):\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nprint(count_primes(10000))\n```\n\nThis script first defines a helper function `is_prime(n)` to check if a number `n` is prime. Then, it defines the main function `count_primes(end)` to count the number of prime numbers up to `end`. Finally, it prints the number of prime numbers from 1 to 10000.\n\nTo run the script, save it to a file named `count_primes.py`, and then execute it using the command `python count_primes.py` in a terminal or command prompt. The script will print the number of prime numbers from 1 to 10000.\n\nLet me know if you encounter any issues or errors when running the script.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"

I'm glad you asked about the relationship between deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nDeep learning is actually a subset of AI, which is a broader field dedicated to creating algorithms and systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. Other subsets of AI include rule-based systems, machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, among others.\n\nDeep learning, on the other hand, is a specific approach to building AI systems that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. In deep learning, we use artificial neural networks, which are composed of interconnected nodes or \"neurons,\" to learn patterns in data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.\n\nDeep learning has been particularly successful in recent years due to several factors, including the availability of large amounts of data, powerful computational resources, and advances in neural network architectures and training algorithms. As a result, deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of tasks, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.\n\nSo, in summary, deep learning is a specific approach to building AI systems that has gained a lot of attention in recent years due to its impressive performance on a variety of tasks. However, it is just one of many approaches to building AI systems, and it is important to understand the broader context of AI in order to fully appreciate the potential and limitations of deep learning.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"

MLflow is an open-source platform for managing machine learning workflows. It was developed by Databricks and was open-sourced in 2018. MLflow provides a number of features to help data scientists and machine learning engineers manage the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, including:\n\n1. **MLflow Tracking**: This is a logging API that allows you to record and query experiments, including code, data, config, and results.\n2. **MLflow Projects**: This is a format for packaging reusable and reproducible data science code, which can be run on different platforms.\n3. **MLflow Models**: This is a convention for packaging machine learning models in multiple formats, making it easy to deploy in different environments.\n4. **MLflow Model Registry**: This is a central repository to store, manage, and serve machine learning models.\n\nHere is a Python code example of how you might use MLflow Tracking to log a simple experiment:\n```python\n# filename: mlflow_example.py\n\nimport mlflow\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Log a parameter (e.g., number of trees in a random forest)\nmlflow.log_param(\"num_trees\", 100)\n\n# Log a metric (e.g., accuracy of a model)\naccuracy = np.random.rand()\nmlflow.log_metric(\"accuracy\", accuracy)\n\n# Log the model\nmlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, \"model\")\n\n# End the run\nmlflow.end_run()\n```\nTo run this code, you would need to have MLflow installed and running on your machine. You can install MLflow using pip:\n```\npip install mlflow\n```\nThen, you can run the code using the following command:\n```\npython mlflow_example.py\n```\nThis will create a new experiment in MLflow and log the parameters, metrics, and model. You can then view the experiment in the MLflow UI.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"

You can install MLflow using pip:\\n```\\npip install mlflow\\n```\\nThen, you can run the code using the following command:\\n```\\npython mlflow_example.py\\n```\\nThis will create a new experiment in MLflow and log the parameters, metrics, and model.

When you need to perform some task with code, use the code to perform the task and output the result. Finish the task smartly.\\nSolve the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. Be clear which step uses code, and which step uses your language skill.\\nWhen using code, you must indicate the script type in the code block. The user cannot provide any other feedback or perform any other action beyond executing the code you suggest. The user can't modify your code. So do not suggest incomplete code which requires users to modify. Don't use a code block if it's not intended to be executed by the user.\\nIf you want the user to save the code in a file before executing it, put # filename: <filename> inside the code block as the first line. Don't include multiple code blocks in one response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant. Check the execution result returned by the user.\\nIf the result indicates there is an error, fix the error and output the code again. Suggest the full code instead of partial code or code changes. If the error can't be fixed or if the task is not solved even after the code is executed successfully, analyze the problem, revisit your assumption, collect additional info you need, and think of a different approach to try.\\nWhen you find an answer, verify the answer carefully. Include verifiable evidence in your response if possible.\\nReply \\\"TERMINATE\\\" in the end when everything is done.\\n    \", \"role\": \"system\"}, {\"content\": \"What is MLflow?\", \"role\": \"user\"}], \"model\": \"databricks-dbrx-instruct\"}",
